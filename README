## Better Cache

Better Cache is a replacement for the default cache template tag library from Django.
It is a better version of {% cache %}

What is better about Better Cache?

 - Nested cache fragments inherit the variables their parent fragments key on
 - Parent cache fragments can be given additional keys by their child cache fragments

An example:

    {% cache 500 "outer" x %}
        y = {{ y }}<br />
        {% cache 500 "inner" y %}
            x = {{ x }}<br />
        {% endcache %}
    {% endcache %}

In the default {% cache %} tag from Django, the inner fragment will not be
rerendered when x changes, because only the outer fragment uses that as a key
variable. The outer fragment will not update with y changes, because only the
inner fragment uses that.

With Better Cache, x and y affect both, so fragments will be re-rendered when
any important variable changes.
