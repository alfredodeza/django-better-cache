   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Welcome to Django Better Cache's documentation!
===============================================

Better Cache originally provided a replacement ``{% cache %}`` tag, but as of
version 0.5 includes a Cache ORM module, as well. Overall, the aim is to
simplify and empower your use of caches with sane defaults and obvious
behaviors.
